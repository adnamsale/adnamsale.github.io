<p>Write code! Mainly for iOS and Android using Java, C++, C & Objective C. Even occasional client-side javascript. Right now, I'm working on <a href="http://lowla.github.io/lowladb-json-database/">LowlaDB</a> - a json datastore that runs pretty much anywhere and can sync with pretty much any backend. So your mobile apps keep working fast and reliably even when your connection is flaky.</p>

<p>Code for my unofficial projects is on <a href="http://www.github.com/adnamsale">GitHub</a>. Want to hack a candy dispenser to serve treats in response to SMS requests? Fed up with solving DropQuotes puzzles? Looking for a solution to a pointless math question? That's the stuff I can't resist.</p>
